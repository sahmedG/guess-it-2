Guess-It-2
Welcome to Guess-It-2! This Python program utilizes Statistical and Probabilities Calculations, specifically Linear Regression, to analyze given data and make predictions about the next range value. It's an interactive and educational project that showcases the application of statistical techniques in predicting patterns.

Features
Reads data from a file.
Utilizes Linear Regression for predictions.
Makes predictions about the next range value.
Provides an interactive and educational experience.
Usage
To run the program, use the following command:

sh
Copy code
python guess_it_2.py data.txt
Replace data.txt with the path to your dataset file.

After reading the file, the program will make predictions about the next range value based on statistical calculations.

Getting Started
Clone the repository:
sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/guess-it-2.git
cd guess-it-2
Run the program:
sh
Copy code
python guess_it_2.py data.txt
Dataset Format
Ensure that your dataset is formatted as follows:

python
Copy code
189
113
121
114
145
110
...
This format represents a graph where the values of the x-axis are the line numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...) and the values of the y-axis are the actual numbers (189, 113, 121, 114, 145, 110, ...).
